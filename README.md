# C Compiler

## ðŸš€ Overview

This is a custom C compiler built for educational and development purposes. It is designed to take C source code as input and produce a target output, such as assembly code, or an intermediate representation. The project aims to demonstrate the fundamental stages of a compiler, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Lexical Analysis:** The compiler's lexer can correctly identify and tokenize C language keywords, identifiers, literals, and operators.
* **Parsing:** A parser is implemented to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the token stream, following the grammar of a subset of the C language.
* **Semantic Analysis:** The compiler performs checks such as type checking and variable declaration to ensure the program is semantically valid.
* **Code Generation:** It can generate [Target Output, e.g., x86 Assembly, a specific bytecode] from the AST.

## ðŸ›  Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build and run this compiler, you will need:

* [List any dependencies, e.g., a C++ compiler like g++ or clang, Make, Flex, Bison, etc.]

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
